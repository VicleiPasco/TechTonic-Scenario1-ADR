ADR-004: Permissions


Context:
To access device functions like storage, push notifications, and network status, we need to manage app permissions.

Status:
Proposed

Decision:
We will be utilizing React Native's built-in permissions management, enhancing it with appropriate native modules as needed.

Rationale:
React Native's straightforward built-in APIs make permission management easier. It makes sure that permissions are handled consistently on the iOS and Android platforms, which improves consistency for developers. React Native also provides strong security capabilities, giving developers a smooth control over permission requests to protect user privacy and app integrity.

Consequences:
Pros: Ensures uniformity and simplifies authorization management.
Cons: Native code may be required to handle advanced or specialized permissions.
