ADR-005: Data Storage


Context:
For offline support, the app must save data locally and synchronize with the server when connected to the internet.

Status:
Proposed

Decision:
For this part, we will be using SQLite for local storage and Firebase Firestore for cloud synchronization.

Rationale:
For offline data storage, React Native offers support for SQLite, a popular and dependable database solution. In addition, Firebase Firestore integrates smoothly with React Native to provide effective data management and cross-device synchronization. It also provides a real-time database with strong synchronization features.

Consequences:
Pros: Scalability, real-time synchronization, and dependable offline support.
Cons: Careful handling of synchronization issues and data consistency is necessary.
