ADR-002: UI Framework


Context:
In order for us to construct the applicationâ€™s interface while maintaining a consistent, effective, and user-friendly design, we will require a UI framework. 

Status:
Proposed

Decision:
In this case, we will be utilizing the React Native UI framework.

Rationale:
React Native offers a consistent user interface for both iOS and Android, guaranteeing cross-platform compatibility. It produces near-native performance, making the user interface fast and responsive. The framework's vast plugin library and active user base encourage development, and the fact that both platforms share a single codebase makes ongoing maintenance easier.

Consequences:
Pros: Reusable components, short development cycles, and powerful community support.
Cons: Some complex functions will require native code.
