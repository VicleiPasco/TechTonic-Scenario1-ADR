ADR-001: Native, Web, or Hybrid App


Context:
We will be responsible for building a mobile application for a retail company that will include features such as, offline support, push notifications, integration with payment gateways, user behavior tracking, image optimization, and localization. This tailors our application for more customer convenience. 

Status:
Proposed

Decision:
We will develop a hybrid app using a framework like React Native.

Rationale:
The simultaneous construction of iOS and Android apps is made possible by cross-platform development, which drastically cuts down on expenses and development time. React Native and Flutter are two examples of hybrid frameworks that provide near-native performance and a seamless user experience. Large communities also help this framework by offering a wealth of libraries and plugins as well as strong support.

Consequences:
Pros: Cross-platform development saves money and effort. Simpler updates and maintenance.
Cons: Possibly less successful than entirely native apps.
