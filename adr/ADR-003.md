ADR-003: Backend Language


Context:
The backend language must incorporate API requests, data synchronization, payment processing, and analytics integration.

Status:
Proposed

Decision:
Node.js with Express.js is what we will be using  for the backend part of our application.

Rationale:
Node.js is very scalable, making it perfect for managing huge numbers of concurrent connections. Its non-blocking I/O operations enable efficient real-time data synchronization and changes. The platform has an extensive collection of libraries and tools, and the common availability of JavaScript/Node.js developers adds to its popularity.

Consequences:
Pros: Rapid development, a strong community, and extensive libraries.
Cons: The single-threaded nature could require additional solutions for CPU-intensive jobs.
