ADR-006: Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks


Context:
For push notifications, payment processing, analytics, image optimization, and localization, we must choose new frameworks and technologies.

Status:
Proposed

Decision:
Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging
Payment Processing: Stripe and PayPal SDKs
Analytics: Google Analytics for Firebase
Image Optimization: Cloudinary for image storage and optimization
Localization: i18next library

Rationale:
Firebase Cloud Messaging  is used for push alerts, guaranteeing dependable platform delivery. Secure transactions within the app are made possible by the integration of the Stripe and PayPal SDKs, which enables payment processing. Strong analytics tools are available with Google Analytics for Firebase to monitor user activity and app performance. With Cloudinary, picture optimization and storage are managed efficiently, improving image delivery speed and quality. The i18next library is used to create localization features, allowing the app's content to be seamlessly translated into several languages and regions.

Consequences:
Pros: Use reliable, well-supported technologies for essential functions.
Cons: Adding to the difficulty of integrating several services.
